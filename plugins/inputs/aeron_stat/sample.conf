  ## Aeron directory path where CnC files are located
  ## Default: system default (usually /dev/shm/aeron-$USER on Linux, /tmp/aeron-$USER on other systems)
  # aeron_dir = "/dev/shm/aeron-myuser"
  
  ## Timeout for reading CnC files
  # read_timeout = "5s"
  
  ## Add custom tags to all metrics
  # [inputs.aeron_stat.tags]
  #   environment = "production"
  #   datacenter = "us-west-1"
